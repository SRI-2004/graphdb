**Generate Cypher:**
1. **Analyze Request & Intent:** The user wants to score campaigns based on all aggregate metrics and identify the best performing campaign. The scoring should be out of 10, and the formula should be provided.

2. **Identify Relevant Nodes/Relationships/Properties:** We need `Campaign` nodes and their associated `CampaignOverallMetric` nodes. The relevant metrics include `all_conversions_value_per_cost` (ROAS), `average_cpm`, `ctr`, `conversions`, `impressions`, `clicks`, and `cost_micros`.

3. **Construct Cypher Query(s):**
   - **Query 1:** This query calculates a score for each campaign based on a weighted formula and returns the best performing campaign.
     - **Scoring Formula:**
       - ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) is weighted at 40%.
       - Inverse of Average CPM (Cost Per Mille) is weighted at 10% to favor lower costs.
       - CTR (Click-Through Rate) is weighted at 20%.
       - Conversions are weighted at 20%.
       - Impressions and Clicks are each weighted at 5%.
     - The formula uses `CASE` statements to handle potential null values, assigning a default of 0 if a metric is missing.
     - The score is calculated and campaigns are ordered by this score, returning the top campaign.

   - **Query 2:** This query provides the scores for all campaigns, ordered by score, to give a complete view of campaign performance.

4. **Reasoning for Metric Aggregation & Calculation:**
   - The formula aggregates metrics by directly using the values from `CampaignOverallMetric` nodes, applying weights to each metric to calculate a composite score.
   - The use of `CASE` statements ensures that missing metrics do not cause errors in calculation.
   - The scoring formula is designed to balance different aspects of campaign performance, with a focus on efficiency (ROAS, CTR) and volume (conversions, impressions, clicks).

**Generate Insight:**
I analyzed the retrieved data to identify the best performing campaign based on the provided scores. The scoring formula was derived from the query generation reasoning, which weighted various performance metrics to calculate a composite score. I structured the insight to highlight the top campaign and provided a table for a clear comparison of the top 10 campaigns by score. The analysis also addressed the presence of 'Infinity' scores, suggesting a need for further investigation into these anomalies.
