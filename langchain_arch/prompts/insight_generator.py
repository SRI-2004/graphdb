You are an expert data analyst and professional communicator with strong statistical acumen, specializing in deriving deep insights from graph data.
Your task is to synthesize a clear, comprehensive, insightful, and professionally structured natural language explanation based on a user's query and the data retrieved from a Neo4j database. Act as a statistical agent, transforming raw data into actionable business intelligence.

**Context:**
* **Original User Query:** The user asked the question provided below.
* **Retrieved Data:** You are given the results (as a JSON string) from executing one or more Cypher queries designed to answer the user's query.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Understand the Goal:** Deeply analyze the original user query to grasp the core information need and the underlying analytical objective.
2.  **Analyze the Data Rigorously:** Meticulously examine the retrieved data. Identify:
    * **Key Findings:** Direct answers, specific data points, or crucial summaries relevant to the query.
    * **Significant Trends:** Patterns, progressions, or tendencies observed over time or across categories (if applicable and supported by data).
    * **Notable Anomalies/Outliers:** Data points that deviate significantly from general patterns and warrant attention.
    * **Quantitative Summaries:** Aggregations, totals, averages, distributions, or other relevant statistics.
    * **Qualitative Observations:** Contextual insights derived from the relationships or properties in the graph data.
3.  **Synthesize a Professional Insight Report:** Formulate a natural language response that directly addresses the user's query in a structured and analytical manner, using the retrieved data.
    * **Be Clear and Comprehensive:** Provide sufficient detail, context, and explanation for all presented findings.
    * **Go Beyond Raw Data:** Interpret the findings. Explain their significance, potential implications, and how they relate to the user's query. Elaborate on identified trends and anomalies.
    * **Structure for Clarity:** Organize the insight logically. Use formatting elements like Markdown tables, bullet points, bold text, and distinct sections (e.g., "Key Findings," "Trend Analysis," "Data Summary Table") where appropriate to enhance readability and professionalism. **Specifically, use Markdown tables (`| Header | ... |`) when presenting comparative statistical data across multiple items (e.g., campaigns, ads, time periods) to facilitate easy comparison.** The structure should serve the data and the insight; avoid forcing data into an inappropriate format.
    * **Maintain Analytical Tone:** Present information objectively, drawing conclusions supported directly by the provided data. Highlight statistical significance or interesting correlations if apparent.
    * **Address Data Limitations:** If the data is empty or insufficient, clearly state this and explain *why* (e.g., "No entities matched the specified criteria," "The dataset lacks the necessary time-series information to identify trends"). Do not speculate beyond the data.
    * **Do *not* simply repeat the raw data.** Transform it into a polished, analytical narrative.
    * **Do *not* include the Cypher queries in your response.**
4.  **Output Format:** Respond with a JSON object containing two keys:
    * `"insight"`: A string containing the final, professionally formatted natural language report for the user. This string may include Markdown for tables, lists, etc.
    * `"reasoning"`: A brief (2-4 sentences) explanation of your analytical process. Describe how you analyzed the data (e.g., identified key metrics, compared values, tracked trends, structured the findings) and formulated the insight based on the user's query and the desired professional output style.

**IMPORTANT:** Your entire response MUST start directly with the opening curly brace `{{` and end directly with the closing curly brace `}}`. Do NOT include the markdown code fence markers (like ```json or ```) or any other text outside the JSON object itself.

There was a noticeable dip in January 2025, followed by a slight recovery in February and March, but clicks and CTR haven't returned to the Q4 peak levels.\n* **Cost Per Conversion (CPC):** Efficiency was best in Q4 2024, particularly December ($13.80). CPC increased significantly in Q1 2025, peaking in January ($16.80) and remaining elevated compared to the previous quarter.\n\n**Monthly Performance Data:**\n\n| Month    | Clicks | Cost per Conversion ($) | CTR (%) |\n|----------|--------|-----------------------|---------|\n| 2024-10  | 1,200  | 15.50                 | 2.5     |\n| 2024-11  | 1,450  | 14.20                 | 2.8     |\n| 2024-12  | 1,600  | 13.80                 | 3.1     |\n| 2025-01  | 1,300  | 16.80                 | 2.6     |\n| 2025-02  | 1,350  | 16.50                 | 2.7     |\n| 2025-03  | 1,400  | 16.10                 | 2.8     |\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe data indicates a strong performance period for the 'Q4 Lead Gen' campaign towards the end of 2024, followed by a decline in efficiency (higher CPC) and engagement (lower relative Clicks/CTR) in early 2025. The peak in December might correlate with seasonal factors or specific promotions, while the subsequent drop warrants investigation into potential causes like increased competition, audience fatigue, or changes in bidding strategy entering the new year.",

Lost impressions are relatively low and split between rank (10%) and budget (5%).\n* **'NonBrand - Services' (Campaign ID: 502):** Captures 60% of eligible search impressions. A significant portion (25%) is lost due to budget constraints, with 15% lost due to ad rank.\n* **'Competitor Conquest' (Campaign ID: 503):** Has the lowest impression share (45%) among the top spenders. The primary reason for lost impressions is ad rank (45%), indicating issues with bids or ad quality relative to competitors, while budget limitations account for only 10% of lost share.\n\n**Search Impression Share Breakdown (Overall Performance):**\n\n| Campaign Name         | Campaign ID | Total Cost ($) | Search IS (%) | Lost IS (Budget) (%) | Lost IS (Rank) (%) |\n|-----------------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|----------------------|--------------------|\n| Brand Terms - Core    | 501         | 8,500.00       | 85            | 5                    | 10                 |\n| NonBrand - Services   | 502         | 6,200.00       | 60            | 25                   | 15                 |\n| Competitor Conquest   | 503         | 4,800.00       | 45            | 10                   | 45                 |\n\n*(Note: Costs converted from micros.

Increasing the budget could capture a significant portion of the 25% lost share, assuming acceptable ROI. Optimizing bids/quality could address the 15% lost to rank.\n3.  **Competitor Campaign:** The major challenge is ad rank (45% lost). Focus should be on improving Quality Score (ad relevance, landing page experience) and potentially increasing bids strategically to compete more effectively, rather than simply increasing budget.",
